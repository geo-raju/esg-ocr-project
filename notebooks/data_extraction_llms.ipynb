    "\n",
    "      ## EXTRACTION PRINCIPLES:\n",
    "      1. **ACCURACY FIRST**: Base all responses strictly on the provided context. Never invent, assume, or extrapolate information not present in the source material.\n",
    "\n",
    "      2. **COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS**: \n",
    "         - Examine ALL provided context chunks thoroughly\n",
    "         - Look for information across different sections, pages, and document parts\n",
    "         - Consider synonyms, alternative terminology, and related concepts\n",
    "         - Connect information that may be scattered across multiple paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "      3. **DIRECT EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT**:\n",
    "         - For each extracted piece of information, provide the EXACT source text that supports your answer\n",
    "         - Use direct quotes whenever possible, preserving original wording and formatting\n",
    "         - When paraphrasing is necessary, stay as close to the original language as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "      4. **STRUCTURED OUTPUT COMPLIANCE**:\n",
    "         - Follow the Pydantic model structure exactly as specified\n",
    "         - Ensure all required fields are populated appropriately\n",
    "         - Use \"Information not available in the provided context\" for missing data rather than leaving fields empty\n",
    "\n",
    "      5. **NUMERICAL DATA PRECISION**:\n",
    "         - Extract exact figures, percentages, dates, and metrics when available\n",
    "         - Preserve units of measurement, currency symbols, and time periods\n",
    "         - Note any baseline years, comparison periods, or contextual qualifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "      6. **REASONING TRANSPARENCY**:\n",
    "         - Clearly explain how each answer was derived from the source material\n",
    "         - Show logical connections between questions and relevant context sections\n",
    "         - Highlight any assumptions or interpretations made during extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "      ## CONTEXT ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:\n",
    "      - **Multiple Perspectives**: Consider how information might be presented in different formats (tables, charts, narrative text, bullet points)\n",
    "      - **Cross-References**: Look for information that spans multiple sections or references other parts of the document\n",
    "      - **Implicit Information**: Extract information that might be implied or stated indirectly\n",
    "      - **Temporal Context**: Pay attention to reporting periods, historical comparisons, and future projections\n",
    "\n",
    "      ## QUALITY ASSURANCE:\n",
    "      - **Consistency Check**: Ensure extracted information aligns logically across all fields\n",
    "      - **Completeness Review**: Verify that all available relevant information has been captured\n",
    "      - **Accuracy Validation**: Double-check that source quotes exactly match the original text\n",
    "\n",
    "      ## HANDLING MISSING INFORMATION:\n",
    "      If specific information is not available in the context:\n",
    "      - State explicitly: \"This information is not available in the provided context\"\n",
    "      - Do not guess, estimate, or use general knowledge to fill gaps\n",

    "      - **Incomplete Data Handling**: If partial information is available, extract what exists and note what information is missing\n",
