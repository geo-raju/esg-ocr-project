# ESG OCR Extraction MVP

This project is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for extracting **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics** from company sustainability reports using:

- OCR for scanned PDFs
- Regex-based metric extraction
- spaCy-based NER for contextual enhancement
- Structured CSV export with tags

The pipeline extracts values like **carbon emissions**, **energy usage**, and **water consumption**, then labels them with relevant **ESG categories**.
